Robotsimulator 1.0
Change Log:

This is a robotsimulation project can show user traces of robots` movement. User can add new robots into the playground. Robots in the playground cannot collision with others or walls. Robots in this program have priorities, elder robots will not give a way to latter robots.

Robots in this program don`t have a destination, it will keep moving all the time.

Perhaps there are some bugs in these program, but we are tring to fix them. 

This program is written in Unbuntu 14 and the GUI part in this program is written with QT5.
