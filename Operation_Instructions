Operation Outlines
In the final interface, there are some matters need attention. The Robot ID should be created one by one beginning with 1.
And the speed should be better between 1 to 8. 
The location of coordinate X and coordinate Y should be between 0 and 400. But here is an important matter that when you
decide the size of the robot the radius plus X or Y should both be less than 400 or it would be out of bound.
The radius are recommended between 1 to 40 and the alert range should be larger than the radius and less than 80.
